/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by granting broad read access while strictly controlling write access based on authentication status.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /homePageContent/{homePageContentId}: Stores content for the home page.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company branding information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unauthenticated users can read all data.
 * - Any authenticated user can create, update, and delete home page content and company profiles. This is suitable for prototyping but should be restricted in a production environment.
