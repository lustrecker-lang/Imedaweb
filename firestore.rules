/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by granting broad access while maintaining basic authorization.
 * It focuses on preventing unauthorized data access and modification, but deliberately avoids strict data validation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/pages/{pageId}`: Stores content for individual pages.
 * - `/companyProfile/{profileId}`: Stores company branding information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Authenticated users can create, update, and delete page content and company profiles.
 * - Data shape validation is skipped to facilitate rapid schema iteration during prototyping.
 * - Listing of documents is enabled for all collections to allow initial exploration.
