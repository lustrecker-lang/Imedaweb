/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by focusing on authorization and skipping data validation.
 * It uses a flexible "Public Read, Owner Write" pattern for the 'pages' collection, allowing any user to view content, but restricting modifications to authenticated users.
 * The 'companyProfile' collection enforces authenticated-user-only write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /pages/{pageId}: Stores content for individual pages.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company branding information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read: The 'pages' collection is readable by all users (including unauthenticated ones).
 * - Authenticated Writes: Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete pages or company profiles.
 * - No Data Validation: The rules do NOT enforce any schema validation on the data being written. This allows for rapid data model iteration during prototyping.
 * - Self-Creation Not Allowed: There are no specific rules for self-creation, as this functionality isn't explicitly defined in the provided data model.
