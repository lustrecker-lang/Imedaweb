/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control.
 * It assumes a model where data is generally private unless explicitly marked as public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /pages/{pageId}: Stores content for individual pages, accessible to authenticated users.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company branding information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - The rules explicitly deny potentially dangerous operations like listing users or granting global access.
 * - Flexible data shapes allow for rapid iteration. Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * (Not applicable in this simplified example.)
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * (Not applicable in this simplified example.)
