/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by granting broad access to authenticated users while preventing unauthenticated access. Data shape validation is omitted for faster iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /homePageContent/{homePageContentId}: Stores home page content. Accessible by all authenticated users.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company profile information. Accessible by all authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Authenticated users can read and write all documents.
 * - Unauthenticated access is denied.
