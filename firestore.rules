/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset defines access control for the Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 *  - Authenticated users have full CRUD access to the /pages and /companyProfile collections.
 *  - The /leads collection allows public creation of documents, simulating a "Contact Us" form.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *  - /pages/{pageId}: Stores content for individual pages (e.g., 'home', 'about').
 *  - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company branding information.
 *  - /leads/{leadId}: Stores lead information submitted through a public form.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Authenticated users can manage pages and company profiles.
 *  - The /leads collection allows public creation of documents.
