/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to home page content, but restricts modifications (create, update, delete) to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The application stores home page content in the `/homePageContent/{homePageContentId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for the `/homePageContent` collection.
 * - Any authenticated user can modify home page content.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `HomePageContent` documents include an `updatedBy` field, which is used to record the user who last modified the document. This is not used for authorization but could be expanded to implement ownership-based restrictions if needed.

     * @allow (create, update, delete) - Any authenticated user can modify the home page content. Example: A user with UID 'user123' creating a new home page content document.
     * @deny (create, update, delete) - An unauthenticated user attempting to modify the home page content.
     * @principle Allows public read access with authenticated-user-only writes.
