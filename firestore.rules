/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for imeda.fr.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to all content while restricting write access to authenticated users.
 * It allows any signed-in user to create, update, and delete data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/pages/{pageId}`: Stores content for individual pages. Accessible for public reading, but requires authentication for modification.
 * - `/companyProfile/{profileId}`: Stores company profile information, accessible for public reading and requires authentication for modification.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for all collections to enable the "public home page".
 * - No role-based access control is implemented, providing equal permissions to any authenticated user for modifications.
