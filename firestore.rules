/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by focusing on authorization and omitting schema validation.
 * It implements strict owner-based access control for user-specific data and allows public read access where appropriate,
 * with the assumption that data validation will be implemented in application code during later development phases.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /pages/{pageId}: Stores content for specific pages.  Authenticated users can create, update, and delete page content.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company profile information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing on authorization.
