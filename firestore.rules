/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for imedawebsite-98ced.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes ease of use and prototyping speed.
 * Any authenticated user can read and modify both the home page content and the company profile.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database contains two top-level collections: `homePageContent` and `companyProfile`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user-specific data or ownership is enforced.
 * - Read and write access is granted to all authenticated users for all data.
 * - Schema validation is minimal to accelerate prototyping.
 *
