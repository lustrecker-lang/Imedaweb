/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset defines access control for the Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * - Authenticated users have full CRUD access to the /pages and /companyProfile collections.
 * - The /leads collection allows public creation of documents, but only allows authenticated users to read/manage them.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /pages/{pageId}: Stores content for specific pages, editable by authenticated users.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company branding information, editable by authenticated users.
 * - /leads/{leadId}: Allows public creation of lead documents, but restricts other access to authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Authenticated users can read and write any document in /pages and /companyProfile.
 * - Unauthenticated users can create documents in /leads, but cannot read, update, or delete them.
