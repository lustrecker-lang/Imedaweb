/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for imeda.fr.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure content management by allowing authenticated users to manage page content and company profiles.
 * It assumes that all authenticated users are authorized to manage all content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /pages/{pageId}: Stores content for individual pages.
 * - /companyProfile/{profileId}: Stores company branding information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All authenticated users have write access to all documents. This simplifies content management.
 * - No explicit ownership is enforced, assuming a collaborative content management model.
